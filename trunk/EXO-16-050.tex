% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$) is performed in
 proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV
 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\fbinv$. 
%Results are interpreted in the context of a $\mathrm{Z'}$-two-Higgs-doublet model, where a vector boson $\mathrm{Z'}$ is produced and decays into a Higgs boson and into two dark matter particles via  an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle, and in terms of the s-channel exchange of a vector mediator $\cPZpr_{B}$ that radiates a Higgs boson and decays into a dark matter particle pair.
The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a $\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction.  Results are interpreted in terms of limits on parameters in the 2HDM+a and baryonic Z' simplified models. For the baryonic Z' model, the presented results constitute the most stringent constraints to date. The 2HDM+a model is tested experimentally for the first time.
}
%In this model, the couplings of the $\cPZpr_{B}$ to 
%leptons are omitted. 
% and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons.
%In this model, a high-mass resonance $\mathrm{Z'}$ decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light
%SM-like scalar Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles.
%No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two
%decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the $m_{\mathrm{Z'}}$- $m_{\textrm{A}}$ phase space.
%For example, the observed data exclude, for $\mathrm{Z'}$ coupling strength
%$g_{\mathrm{Z'}} = 0.8$,

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb$^{-1}$. Results are interpreted in the framework of the Type-2 two-Higgs-doublet model and  baryonic-$\textrm{Z}^{'}$ model.
