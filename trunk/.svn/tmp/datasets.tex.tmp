%The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. 
=======
The datasets utilized for the search are defined online by either the
presence of large missing transverse momentum (\MET) or the presence
of an energetic electron. The \MET dataset includes muon pass-through
triggers, which allow for selecting events with high $\MET$ or high
muon recoil. From these datasets we define signal regions as well as
control regions, which require the presence of muons or elections, offline.
%Control regions obtained by requiring the presence of muons or electrons are employed in the search for $\MET+\mathrm{h}(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}})$; therefore, the \MET and SingleElectron datasets are used for offline analysis.

Signal samples are generated at leading order (LO) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics perturbation theory (QCD) using the \MADGRAPH{\textsc 5\_aMC@NLO}~\cite{amcatnlo} program.

Signal samples are generated with \MADGRAPH{\textsc
  5\_aMC@NLO}~\cite{amcatnlo} at leading order (LO) accuracy in
quantum chromodynamics perturbation theory (QCD). In addition to the
mono-h signal, we model expected backgrounds from V+jets (where V can
be a $W$ or $Z$ boson), top quark pair and single top production,
heavy dibosons, and SM Higgs boson production.

To model the expectation from SM Higgs boson backgrounds as well as the \ttbar and single top quark backgrounds, the {\sc Powheg~v2}~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd} generator is used. All these processes are generated at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD.
% 
Events with multiple jets produced through the strong interaction (referred to as QCD multijet events) are generated at LO using \MADGRAPH{\textsc 5\_aMC@NLO} v2.3.3.

We model the expectation from SM Higgs boson backgrounds as well as the \ttbar and
single top quark backgrounds using {\sc
  Powheg~v2}~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}; these
processes are all generated at NLO in QCD. Production of Z+jets, W+jets, and $\gamma$+jets as well as
events with multiple jets produced through strong interactions are modeled at
LO using \MADGRAPH{\textsc 5\_aMC@NLO} v2.3.3. In all processes, jets
stemming from the matrix element calculations are matched to parton
shower jets using the MLM prescription~\cite{mlm}. The background
models are corrected by weighting the \pt of the respective boson with
NLO QCD $K$-factors obtained from large samples of events generated
with \MADGRAPH{\textsc 5\_aMC@NLO} and the FxFx merging
technique~\cite{fxfx}. The generated events are further corrected by
applying NLO electroweak $K$-factors obtained from
calculations~\cite{Kuhn:2005gv,Kallweit:2015fta,Kallweit:2015dum} that
depend on boson \pt. Predictions for diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) production are obtained at LO with {\sc Pythia 8.205}~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}.

For all the processes the LO or NLO the NNPDF30 parton distribution function~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} is used at LO or NLO. 
%
Parton showering, fragmentation, and hadronization are simulated with {\sc Pythia 8.2} using the CUETP8M1~\cite{ue1,ue2} tune. 
%
A {\sc Geant4}-based simulation of the CMS detector~\cite{geant4} is applied to all the simulated processes. 
%
Additional inelastic proton-proton interactions in the same or a neighboring bunch crossing (pileup) is included in the simulation.
%
The pileup distribution is corrected to match the corresponding distribution observed in data.
