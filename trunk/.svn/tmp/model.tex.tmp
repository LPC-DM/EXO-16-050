The search presented in this Letter is interpreted in terms of two benchmark simplified models: a Type-2 Two Higgs Doublet Model with an additional vector \cPZpr boson (\cPZpr-2HDM)~\cite{Lee:1973iz,Branco:2011iw}, where the \cPZpr\ is produced resonantly and decays into a Higgs boson plus an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle \Az, which decays into two DM particles, $\chi\bar{\chi}$; and a baryonic $\cPZpr_{B}$ model (Z'-Baryonic) where a vector mediator $\cPZpr_{B}$ is exchanged in the s-channel, radiates a Higgs boson, and subsequently decays into two DM particles.

The Type-2 2HDM model is used to formulate
the Higgs sector. The gauge symmetry of the SM is extended by a
$U(1)_{\cPZpr}$ group with a corresponding new massive \cPZpr\ gauge boson.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, the Higgs doublets attain vacuum
expectation values $v_u$ and $v_d$,
resulting in five physical Higgs bosons:
a light neutral CP-even scalar \Ph, assumed to be the
observed 125\GeV Higgs boson; a heavy neutral CP-even scalar \PH;
a neutral CP-odd scalar \Az; and two charged scalars \Hpm. Only the masses \maz and \mzp affect the kinematic
properties of the physics objects studied in this search.

Mass hypotheses for the \cPZpr\ resonance and for the \Az particle are
considered between 600 and 4000\GeV and between 300 and 800\GeV, respectively. The mass of the DM particles $m_{\chi}$
is assumed to be less than or equal to 100\GeV. The 
ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields coupling to the up-type and down-type
quarks, $\tan\beta$, and the coupling of the \Az particle to DM
particles, $g_{\chi}$, are both fixed at unity. 
Hypotheses for the mass of the \Az particle to be less than 300\GeV are excluded by constraints on flavor changing
neutral currents from measurements of $\cPqb\rightarrow \cPqs\gamma$ \cite{Branco:2011iw},
and therefore are not considered. 
The branching fraction ${\cal B}(\Az\rightarrow\chi\overline{\chi})$
is forced to be $100\%$ for all the considered mass hypotheses and the signal cross sections are calculated for the fixed value of Z' gauge coupling $\gzp = 0.8$.
For the masses of the other Higgs bosons, we assume $m_{\PH}=m_{\Hpm}=m_{\Az}$.

The baryonic $\cPZpr_{B}$ model is an extension of the SM and 
assumes that the baryon number $B$ is gauged, with the Z' being the gauge 
boson of U(1)$_{B}$. The model predicts the existence of a new 
stable baryonic state that is neutral under SM gauge symmetries. This new 
particle is an excellent DM candidate. 
To generate the  \cPZpr\ mass, a ``baryonic Higgs'' scalar is introduced to 
spontaneously break the U(1)$_B$ symmetry. Analogous to the SM, there remains 
a physical baryonic Higgs particle, h$_{B}$, with a coupling of h$_{B}$Z'Z' 
and vacuum expectation value of $v_{B}$. 
The \cPZpr\ and SM Higgs boson h interact with a coupling strength of 
$g_{\text{h}\cPZpr\cPZpr} = m_{\cPZpr}^{2} \sin \theta/v_{B}$, where $\theta$ is the h-h$_{B}$ 
mixing angle. 
In the search for this model, the chosen value for the \cPZpr\ coupling to quarks, $g_\text{q}$, is 0.25; furthermore, $g_\chi$ and $\sin\theta$ are 1 and 0.3, respectively. The ratio $g_{\text{h}\cPZpr\cPZpr}/M_{\mathrm{Z}'}$ is assumed to be unity. 



%The quantity \ptvecmiss, calculated as the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momentum (\pt) of all objects identified in an event, 
%represents the total
%momentum carried by the DM particles.
%The magnitude of this vector is referred to as \MET.
%For a given value of \mzp, the \pt of the \Az decreases as its mass increases.
%Therefore, the \MET spectrum softens with increasing \Az masses.
%A comparison of the \MET distributions expected from representative scenarios of the \cPZpr-2HDM model and the \cPZpr-Barzonic model are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:met_signals}.

The \cPZpr-2HDM model in general has a significant harder \MET~spectrum than the \cPZpr-Barzonic model, which makes the former easier to distinguish from SM background processes.}
