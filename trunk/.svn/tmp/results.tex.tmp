The expected yields for each background in the SR as determined in the fit under the background-only assumption are presented in Table~\ref{tab:eventYieldTable}, together with the sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties and the observed data yields.

Figure \ref{Fig_sr} shows the post-fit \MET distribution in the SR for all SM backgrounds, as well as the observed data distribution. We present the distributions for two scenarios: in the first case, the fit has been performed simultaneously in all analysis regions; in the second case, the SR has been masked from the likelihood and the background model is obtained from a fit in the CRs only. For both cases, the data agrees with the background predictions at the 1$\sigma$ level.

Since no significant excess over the SM background expectation of events is observed, the results of this search are interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the production cross 
section of DM candidates in association with a Higgs boson. 
The upper limits are calculated at 95\% confidence level (CL) using a modified frequentist method (CL$_s$) \cite{yellowReport, bib:CLS1, bib:CLS2} computed with an asymptotic approximation \cite{bib:CLS3}.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits} shows the expected and observed exclusion range as a function of $m_{Z'}$ and $m_{\text{A}}$ for the Z'-2HDM model, and as a function of $m_{Z'}$ and $m_{\chi}$ for the Z'-Barzonic model.  For the Z'-2HDM model, we exclude a Z' mass of 2.30\TeV with an expected exclusion of 2.55\TeV for a mass $m_{A^0}=300\GeV$. The lower exclusion boundary is given by $m_{Z'}=600\GeV$. The largest $A^0$ mass which can be excluded is 700\GeV for a corresponding Z' mass of 1.75\TeV, with an expected exclusion of $M_{A^0}=800\GeV$. For the Z'-Baryonic model and a DM mass of 1\GeV, masses $m_{Z'}<1.45\TeV$ are excluded. The expected exclusion boundary is 1.75\TeV. This is the first time that limits on this model have been set in the mono-H($\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$) channel.


Results on the associated production of DM particles with Higgs boson decaying in a b-quark pair have been presented. Limits on the production cross section predicted by the \cPZpr-2HDM and the baryonic $\cPZpr_{B}$ model are set and they constitute the most stringent limits placed by CMS on the parameters in these models so far (compare~\cite{Sirunyan:2017hnk}). For the \cPZpr-2HDM model, results are in agreement with what is reported in~\cite{atlashbb} for $m_\text{A}=300\GeV$. It should be noted that, while we are assuming $m_{\PH}=m_{\Hpm}=m_{\Az}$, Ref.~\cite{atlashbb} uses a fixed mass of 300\GeV for the Higgs bosons \PH and \Hpm, thus exclusions for $m_\text{A}>300\GeV$ are not directly comparable.
