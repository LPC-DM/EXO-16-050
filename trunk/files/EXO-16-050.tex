% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{A search for dark matter is performed in events with large missing transverse momentum
 and a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks. 
The study is conducted analyzing the data
from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV collected in 2016 with the
CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\fbinv$. 
%Results are interpreted in the context of a $\mathrm{Z'}$-two-Higgs-doublet model, where a vector boson $\mathrm{Z'}$ is produced and decays into a Higgs boson and into two dark matter particles via  an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle, and in terms of the s-channel exchange of a vector mediator $\cPZpr_{B}$ that radiates a Higgs boson and decays into a dark matter particle pair.
No excess of events is observed in the data with respect to the standard model prediction and limits on the associated production of dark matter particles and a Higgs boson are set.
%, and 95\% CL$_{S}$ upper limits on the cross sections of both models are set. }
}
%In this model, the couplings of the $\cPZpr_{B}$ to 
%leptons are omitted. 
% and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons.
%In this model, a high-mass resonance $\mathrm{Z'}$ decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light
%SM-like scalar Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles.
%No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two
%decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the $m_{\mathrm{Z'}}$- $m_{\textrm{A}}$ phase space.
%For example, the observed data exclude, for $\mathrm{Z'}$ coupling strength
%$g_{\mathrm{Z'}} = 0.8$,

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb$^{-1}$. Results are interpreted in the framework of the Type-2 two-Higgs-doublet model and  baryonic-$\textrm{Z}^{'}$ model.

% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
